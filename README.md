<h1 style="text-align: center">Welcome To My Github!</h2>

<p>I am a self-taught game and software developer. <br>My main tools for game development are Unreal Engine 4, Blender, and C++ although I also have experience with using C# and Unity 2D, as well as creating web browser games with JavaScript.</p>
<p>For software, my tools of choice are Python and JavaScript. My goal is to create ad free, simple to use, and intuitive applications.</p>

<p>I am working on an app that allows the user to input their name, job title, 6 links, and 8-16 skills.
A digital business card will be created and a qr code that leads to it will be generated.
A simple and easy way to share contact information and share links to your projects,
profiles, or anything else you would like people to see.</p>
